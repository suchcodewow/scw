Hey! You have your own server. Cool! Make sure it meets the following criteria:

- It's running ubuntu linux 16+.
- It has sufficient resources (recommended 4+ cores and 4GB+ memory).
- It has at least 16GB of free space.
- It can reliably connect to the internet.

If you don't meet these prerequisites, you could try [Multipass](./1multipass) or the [cloud hosted](./1cloud) option.

## (Recommended) Update your server

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
